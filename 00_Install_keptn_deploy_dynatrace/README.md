# Installing Keptn and configuring Dynatrace

## 1. Accounts üé´
 
* **Dynatrace** - We will use Dynatrace to monitor our cluster as well as all our sample application. Therefore, create an account for a [free trial Dynatrace SaaS tenant](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial). See details in the [Keptn docs](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.5.0/reference/monitoring/dynatrace/).
* **(recommended:) GCP account** - A GCP account is suggested to utilize the Google Cloud Shell. It is recommended to sign up for personal free trial to have full admin rights and to not cause any issues with your enterprise account. Google Cloud Shell is free to use with an GCP account, [more information here](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier). Use this link to sign up for a free trial: https://cloud.google.com/free/


## 2. Tools üõ†Ô∏è
In this workshop, we are providing you a Dynatrace Account as well as login to a bastion host connected to your GKE Cluster. 

# Install Keptn ‚öôÔ∏è

## 1) Install Keptn

Install the Keptn control plane components into your cluster, using the **Keptn CLI**:

```console
keptn install --platform=gke
```
Please note that the Keptn install command does offer other platforms as well. A list of all supported platforms can be retrieved by executing `keptn install --help` .

The install will take about **5 minutes** to perform.

The Keptn CLI will now install all Keptn core components into your cluster, as well authenticating the Keptn CLI at the end of the installation. 

Once the installation is finished you should find a couple of pods running in your keptn namespace.

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n keptn

## 2) Collect tokens for Dynatrace

1. Make sure you have followed the prerequisites and have a Dynatrace tenant ready. If not, please sign up for a [free Dynatrace trial](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial). There is no need to install anything on your local machine. For now, just make sure you have created your tenant.

1. To be able to connect a Dynatrace tenant to the cluster, we will need an API as well as an Platform as a Service (PaaS) token from the Dynatrace tenant.
We recommend creating a temporary file and copying the following lines into an editor, fill them out and keep them as a reference for later:

    ```
    Dynatrace Host Name (e.g. abc12345.live.dynatrace.com):
    Dynatrace API Token:
    Dynatrace PaaS Token:
    ```

1. Login to your Dynatrace tenant and retrieve the tenant ID from the address bar of your browser. Please do copy only the characters between `https://` and the first `/` after the .dynatrace.com. E.g., a valid tenant ID would be abc1234.live.dynatrace.com 

    Copy it to your temporary file to keep it for later.

1. To retrieve the API and PaaS Token, login to your Dynatrace tenant and navigate in the left-hand menu to **Settings -> Integration -> Dynatrace API** and click on **Generate token**. Provide a name, e.g., **keptn-token** and make sure to create a token with the following permissions:
    <details><summary>Open for permissions</summary>
    
    - Access problem and event feed, metrics and topology
    - Access logs
    - Configure maintenance windows
    - Read configuration
    - Write configuration
    - Capture request data
    - Real user monitoring JavaScript tag management
    </details>

    Copy the value of the token into your temporary file.

1. Retrieve the PaaS Token by navigating to **Settings -> Integration ->Platform as a Service** and generate a new token again with a name of your choice, e.g., **keptn-token**. Copy the value to your temporary file to keep it as a reference.



## 3) Install Dynatrace

This will install the Dynatrace OneAgent Operator into your cluster.

1. Create a role binding to grant your GKE user a cluster-admin before you can create the role necessary for the OneAgent Operator in later steps.
    ```console
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud config get-value account)
    ```

1. Navigate to the `dynatrace-service` folder: 
    ```console
    cd ~/scripts/dynatrace-service/deploy/scripts
    ```
1. Define your credentials.
    ```console
    ./defineDynatraceCredentials.sh
    ```
1. Install Dynatrace OneAgent Operator on your Cluster.
    ```console
    ./deployDynatraceOnGKE.sh
    ```
    Please note that the Dynatrace OneAgent Operator can be installed on other platforms as well and the scripts can be found in the same folder.

The install will take about **2 minutes** to perform.

## 4) Expose Keptn's Bridge (This step is handled when running the previous shell script) 

The [Keptn‚Äôs bridge](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.5.0/reference/keptnsbridge/) provides an easy way to browse all events that are sent within Keptn and to filter on a specific Keptn context. When you access the Keptn‚Äôs bridge, all Keptn entry points will be listed in the left column. Please note that this list only represents the start of a deployment of a new artifact. Thus, more information on the executed steps can be revealed when you click on one event.

In the default installation of Keptn, the bridge is only accessible via `kubectl port-forward`. To make things easier for workshop participants, we will expose it by creating a public URL for this component.

1. Navigate to the folder to expose the bridge.
    ```console
    cd /usr/keptn/scripts/expose-bridge
    ```

1. Execute the following script.
    ```console
    ./exposeBridge.sh
    ```

1. It will give you the URL of your Bridge at the end of the script. Open a browser and verify the bridge is running.
